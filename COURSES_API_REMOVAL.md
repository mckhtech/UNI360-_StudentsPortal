# Courses API Removal from Universities Page

## Date: 2025-10-13

## Issue
The Universities page was making calls to the courses API (`/api/v1/courses`) which was returning 404 errors because the backend doesn't have this endpoint available. The error was preventing universities from loading properly.

## Root Cause
The code was attempting to:
1. Load courses data alongside universities data
2. Filter universities based on course availability
3. Calculate university statistics using course information
4. Load course-specific filter options (subject areas, degree types) from the courses API

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Course API Import
**File:** `src/pages/Universities.tsx` (Line 40)
- **Before:** `import { universityAPI, courseAPI } from "@/services/api";`
- **After:** `import { universityAPI } from "@/services/api";`

### 2. Removed Course State Variable
**Lines:** 897-901
- Removed `const [courses, setCourses] = useState([]);`
- Now only tracking universities state

### 3. Simplified Data Loading (loadData function)
**Lines:** 966-1030
- **Removed:**
  - All `courseAPI.getCourses()` calls
  - Course-based university filtering logic
  - Course search result processing
  - Course statistics calculation
  
- **Result:** Universities are now loaded directly without any course dependency
- The function now:
  1. Loads universities only (with or without search)
  2. Applies university-specific filters only
  3. Sets universities state directly
  4. Calls `calculateUniversityStats` with empty courses array

### 4. Updated Error Handling
**Lines:** 1094-1098
- Removed `setCourses([])` from error handling
- Only resets universities state on error

### 5. Removed Course API from Filter Loading
**Lines:** 1146-1197 (loadFilterOptions function)
- **Removed:**
  - `courseAPI.getSubjectAreas()` call
  - `courseAPI.getDegreeTypes()` call
  
- **Updated fallback logic:**
  - Now only loads cities and states from university API
  - Sets subject areas and degree types to empty arrays
  - Relies on `getUniversitiesWithFilters()` endpoint if available

## Current Behavior

### ✅ What Works Now
1. **Universities load successfully** without 404 errors
2. **University filtering** by city, state, language works
3. **Search functionality** for universities works
4. **University list displays** with all existing UI/UX preserved
5. **Apply Now flow** still works with payment and application creation

### ⚠️ Current Limitations
1. **No course-based filtering** - Filters for degree type, subject area, intake season won't filter by courses
2. **No course statistics** - University cards won't show course counts or tuition ranges derived from courses
3. **Course modal still exists** - The course modal component is still in the code but won't be populated with course data when opened

## API Endpoints Now Used

### Universities Page Only Uses:
1. `GET /api/v1/universities` - List all universities
2. `POST /api/v1/universities/search` - Search universities
3. `GET /api/v1/universities/{id}` - Get university by ID
4. `GET /api/v1/universities/filters` - Get filter options (if available)
5. `GET /api/v1/universities/cities` - Get available cities
6. `GET /api/v1/universities/states` - Get available states

### NOT USED Anymore:
- ❌ `GET /api/v1/courses` - Courses list
- ❌ `GET /api/v1/courses/subject-areas` - Subject areas
- ❌ `GET /api/v1/courses/degree-types` - Degree types

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify universities load:** Open the Universities page and confirm universities display without errors
2. **Check console:** Verify no 404 errors for `/api/v1/courses`
3. **Test filters:** Try city, state, and language filters
4. **Test search:** Search for universities by name
5. **Test Apply Now:** Verify the payment and application creation flow still works

## Future Enhancements

If/when the courses API becomes available:
1. Re-add `courseAPI` import
2. Restore course loading in `loadData` function
3. Re-enable course-based filtering
4. Restore course statistics calculation
5. Re-add course filter options (subject areas, degree types)

## Related Files
- `src/pages/Universities.tsx` - Main file modified
- `src/services/api.ts` - API service definitions (unchanged)
- `src/services/studentProfile.ts` - Application creation (unchanged)

## Impact on Other Pages
- **Applications page:** No impact (uses different API)
- **Profile pages:** No impact
- **Other pages:** No impact

## Notes
- All UI/UX remains unchanged
- Only backend API integration was modified
- The CourseModal component remains in the code for future use
- University statistics now calculated without course data
