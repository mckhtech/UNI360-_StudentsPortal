# Backend API Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Universities and Applications pages with the backend APIs while preserving all existing UI/UX designs.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Applications Page (`src/pages/Applications.tsx`)**

#### API Integration
- **List Applications**: Integrated with `GET /api/v1/students/applications`
  - Handles new response format: `{ success, message, data: { applications: [...], pagination, summary } }`
  - Extracts applications from `response.data.applications`
  - Maps new API fields to UI format

#### Field Mappings
- `referenceNumber` → Display reference number
- `universityName` → University name in card
- `programName` → Course/program name in card
- `intakeTerm` (e.g., `WINTER_2026`) → Formatted as "Winter 2026"
- `status` → Normalized to lowercase and mapped to status badges
- `completionPercentage` → Progress indicator
- `workflowProgress.estimatedCompletion` → Formatted deadline

#### Status Configuration
Added support for new backend statuses:
- `DRAFT` → "Draft"
- `SUBMITTED` → "Submitted"
- `IN_WORKFLOW` → "In Progress"
- `PENDING` → "Pending"
- `UNDER_REVIEW` → "Under Review"
- `ACCEPTED` → "Accepted"
- `REJECTED` → "Rejected"
- `WAITLIST` → "Waitlisted"
- `WITHDRAWN` → "Withdrawn"

#### Submit Application Flow
- Uses `POST /api/v1/students/applications/{applicationId}/submit`
- Includes required confirmation data:
  ```javascript
  {
    confirmationStatement: "I confirm that all information provided is accurate and complete.",
    agreeToTerms: true,
    additionalNotes: "Application submitted via student portal."
  }
  ```

---

### 2. **Universities Page (`src/pages/Universities.tsx`)**

#### Create Application After Payment
- **POST /api/v1/students/applications** called after successful payment
- Payload structure:
  ```javascript
  {
    studentId: user.id,              // Numeric user ID from token
    targetUniversityId: university.id,
    targetCourseId: selectedCourse?.id || "",
    targetSemester: "WINTER",         // Dynamic based on course intake
    targetYear: 2026
  }
  ```

#### Course Application Flow
1. User clicks "Apply Now" on course in CourseModal
2. Course data is stored in state
3. Payment modal opens
4. On payment success:
   - Creates application via backend API
   - Navigates to Applications page
   - New application appears in list

#### Optional Submit After Create
Commented code available to auto-submit after creation:
```javascript
if (response?.data?.id) {
  await submitApplication(response.data.id, {
    confirmationStatement: "...",
    agreeToTerms: true,
    additionalNotes: "..."
  });
}
```

## API Endpoints Used

### Applications
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/v1/students/applications` | GET | List student applications |
| `/api/v1/students/applications` | POST | Create new application |
| `/api/v1/applications/{id}` | GET | Get application details |
| `/api/v1/students/applications/{id}/submit` | POST | Submit application |
| `/api/v1/applications/{id}` | PUT | Update application |

### Authentication
- All requests include `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
- Token retrieved from localStorage via `tokenService.js`
- User ID extracted from authenticated user context

---

## Key Features Preserved

✅ **Empty states** - Graceful handling when no applications exist
✅ **Error handling** - User-friendly error messages with retry options
✅ **Loading states** - Spinner animations during API calls
✅ **Status badges** - Color-coded status indicators
✅ **Progress tracking** - Completion percentage visualizations
✅ **Payment flow** - Demo payment modal preserved
✅ **Navigation** - Seamless transitions between pages

## Response Format Handling

### List Applications Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Request completed successfully",
  "data": {
    "applications": [
      {
        "id": "uuid",
        "referenceNumber": "APP251025102510000003",
        "universityName": "Technical University of Munich",
        "programName": "Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering",
        "intakeTerm": "WINTER_2026",
        "status": "DRAFT",
        "completionPercentage": 0,
        "workflowProgress": {
          "estimatedCompletion": "2026-04-13T06:50:26Z",
          "pendingTasks": 0,
          "requiresStudentAction": false
        }
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {...},
    "summary": {...}
  }
}
```

### Create Application Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "reference_number": "APP251025102510000003",
    "student_id": 1,
    "target_university_id": "uuid",
    "target_course_id": "uuid",

## Future Enhancements

### Optional Features (Commented in Code)
1. **Auto-submit after create**: Uncomment lines in `handlePaymentSuccess`
2. **Application detail view**: Use `getApplicationById` endpoint
3. **Update application**: Use PUT endpoint for draft applications
4. **Pagination**: Implement using `pagination` data from response
5. **Filters**: Filter applications by status, university, etc.
